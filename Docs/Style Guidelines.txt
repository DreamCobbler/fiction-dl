fiction-dl doesn't exactly follow PEP 8 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), but it does take some inspiration from it. Most important points are:

	- Use four spaces instead of tabs.
	- Make lines no longer than 100 characters.
	- Always use type hints for function arguments and returns.
	- Don't leave out unnecessary imports laying around.
	- Document every class and every function using Doxygen syntax.
