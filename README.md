<sup>**[1]** **fiction-dl** is also capable of downloading whole collections and series.</sup>

It is also capable of reading stories saved in text files. You can put the HTML-formatted story in a raw text file and use **fiction-dl** to translate it to some more civilized format.

### Formatting stories

Downloaded stories are auto-formatted and saved in a few file formats:

| File Format                                                          | Requirements                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) (.html)                   | *None.*                                                               |
| [EPUB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB) (.epub)                   | *None.*                                                               |
| [MOBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobipocket) (.mobi)             | [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) installed on the machine.       |
| [OpenDocument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument) (.odt)    | *None.*                                                               |
| [Portable Document Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) (.pdf) | [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) installed on the machine. |

### Embedding images

The application can download images found in story content and embed them in output files.

### Typographic corrections

**fiction-dl** automatically applies basic typographic corrections to the content of downloaded stories.

| Source Text                  | Corrected Text           |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Lorem ipsum... dolor.        | Lorem ipsum… dolor.      |
| Lorem ipsum...dolor.         | Lorem ipsum… dolor.      |
| Lorem ipsum...... dolor.     | Lorem ipsum… dolor.      |
| Lorem ipsum , dolor.         | Lorem ipsum, dolor.      |
| Lorem ipsum????? Dolor.      | Lorem ipsum? Dolor.      |
| Lorem ipsum - dolor.         | Lorem ipsum — dolor.     |

### Packing stories

If you're downloading a lot of short stories, you can *pack* them into a single file, using the "-pack" command line option. This way you're adding only a single item to your Kindle book list, instead of many.

## ✿ Installation

You can install **fiction-dl** using *pip*:

    python3 -m pip install --upgrade fiction-dl

(If the package's already installed, this command will also update it.)

If you're running a Debian-derived Linux distribution, you might also need to install the following packages:

    apt-get install libgl1-mesa-glx libglib2.0-0 libmupdf-dev

(**fiction-dl** uses OpenCV for processing downloaded images, which requires them to be installed. PyMuPDF requires libmupdf-dev when it's being built from the source.)

## ✿ Usage

To download a story from a URL, simply type:

    fiction-dl URL

In order to download multiple stories, create a text file and place the URLs in it, each one in a separate line. Then type:

    fiction-dl YourFilesName

### Text File Extractor

Create a text file meant to contain the story. In its first lines type:

    LOCAL TEXT STORY
    *URL*
    *The Title of the Story*
    *The Author*
    *The One-Line Summary*

Follow it by the story's content, wrapped in HTML tags. Then call:

    fiction-dl FilePath.txt

You can insert chapter-breaks in the story by typing "CHAPTER BREAK LINE" in an empty line.
